The previous AI engineer initiated the E‑commerce Liviano + IA project for Alcom, focusing on a B2B platform. The process started with clarifying the MVP scope: Claude Sonnet 4 for AI, quote-only e-commerce, WhatsApp integration, product catalog, and AI search. The engineer successfully built the core FastAPI backend and React frontend, implementing product listings, services pages, and an AI search modal. Key decisions involved using  for initial setup and  for iterative refinements. The engineer then addressed user feedback on UI/UX, including animated KPI sections, a video background hero (troubleshooting video loading issues), extensive slogan and subtitle refinements, and multiple logo iterations until a green ALLCOM logo was selected. A comprehensive green color palette was then applied site-wide. Subsequent features included dynamic vertical KPIs, initial SEO optimization (meta tags, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, Schema.org), a visual product menu with hover effects, and animated partner/client sections. The last major task involves creating an IMIN alliance page with specific product and partnership details, for which the engineer is currently gathering information.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to reconceptualize Alcom's B2B site, presenting solutions (kiosks, POS), services (installation, custom development), and a light e-commerce model for direct purchase of accessories and quotation for equipment. Key features include AI integration (semantic search, smart comparison, pre-sales assistant, RAG with manuals), case studies, lead maximization, and technical SEO. The site requires a sitemap, sticky header with mega-menu, wireframes, base copy, functional specifications, and data models (Product, Category, Service, CaseStudy, etc.). Integrations include WhatsApp, CRM, payments (MVP: Webpay/MercadoPago for consumables), GA4/GTM analytics, and reCAPTCHA. The UI emphasizes modern, fast, accessible design with Shadcn/UI components, specific font guidelines, and micro-animations. The initial MVP focused on product catalog, quote cart, AI search, and WhatsApp mockups. Subsequent requests included animated KPI sections, a video background for the hero, logo updates, a site-wide green color palette refresh, a separate block of vertical KPIs, initial SEO meta tags/files, a visual product menu with hover effects, and animated partner/client carousels. The current pending major feature is an IMIN alliance page under the product menu.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with creating a new IMIN alliance page. This page needs to be a sub-menu item under Productos and showcase IMIN's top 5 products. It requires details about the alliance (e.g., 3-year warranty, compatibility with Justo), product photos, brief descriptions, Chilean market applications with examples, example prices in CLP, and consistent branding (badges, icons, modern effects). The engineer has just acknowledged this request and has started gathering information about IMIN to proceed with the page creation. The overall site is currently featuring a refreshed green color palette, a video-enabled hero section with a dynamic slogan (Tecnología para tiendas, sin enredos and Nos encanta que te vaya bien !!!), animated KPI sections (both grid and vertical progress bars), a visual product menu, and distinct partner and client sections. The header and footer display the chosen green ALLCOM logo, and a Soluciones dropdown menu now links to the newly created , , and  pages, all adhering to unique color schemes. Initial SEO structures are in place.
