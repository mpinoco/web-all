The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the E‑commerce Liviano + IA application. Initially, the focus was on building the core B2B platform with AI search, product catalog, and basic UI. The trajectory details the implementation of several key features. It started with creating the IMIN Alliance page, incorporating brand-specific designs, product listings, and interactive elements. Following this, the engineer developed dedicated pages for Wintec and Balanças Marques, each with unique layouts, product showcases, and brand-aligned aesthetics, including resolving image loading issues. A significant addition was the Inteligencia Artificial page, featuring dynamic dashboards, AI engine logos, rotating suggestions, and a visually striking hero section. The engineer also enhanced the main product menu with contextual images and built a comprehensive Team page with leadership profiles and company values. The current task involves refining the overall site's green color palette, specifically changing a green shade on the main page.

The overarching goal is to transform Alcom's B2B online presence into a comprehensive platform offering solutions (kiosks, POS), services (installation, custom development), and a light e-commerce model for accessories and equipment quotes. Core features include AI integration (semantic search, smart comparison, pre-sales assistant, RAG), case studies, lead maximization, and robust technical SEO. UI/UX emphasizes modern design with Shadcn/UI, specific fonts, micro-animations, and a green color palette.
