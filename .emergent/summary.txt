The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the E‑commerce Liviano + IA application. Initially, the focus was on building core B2B platform functionalities. The trajectory details the implementation of several key features: creating dedicated alliance pages for IMIN, Wintec, and Balanças Marques, each with unique designs and product showcases. A significant addition was the Inteligencia Artificial page, featuring dynamic dashboards and AI suggestions. The engineer also enhanced the main product menu and built a comprehensive Team page.

UI/UX refinements included a global green color palette adjustment on the main page, which was later reverted by user request. A new brand logo and slogan were added to the homepage. Two Cartelería Digital pages were developed, incorporating detailed content, interactive elements, image backgrounds, and monetization features, with ongoing iconography refinements. Extensive SEO was implemented across pages, utilizing  and centralized data, following competitor analysis. A compilation error related to a missing Lucide icon was addressed. The immediate next task is to create a login-gated main page for deployment protection, featuring a custom background, text, a minimalist password field, and the removal of all navigation elements and the Emergent watermark.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a compilation error in  related to a missing Lucide icon (). The user then requested the creation of a new, temporary main page that acts as a login barrier for the entire application during deployment. This new page needs to feature a specific uploaded logo as a full background image, display the text Tecnología para tiendas sin enredos, and include a minimalist login box on the right side. This login box should only require a password () and an ingresar button. Crucially, all existing navigation menus (header and footer) must be disabled on this introductory login page. Furthermore, the user explicitly asked to remove the Emergent watermark from all pages. The AI engineer has acknowledged this request and is preparing to implement the login page and the watermark removal as the next major tasks.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Implement the new login-gated main page (index.html) including the background, text, password field (4227), and disable all menus.
